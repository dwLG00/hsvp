## Hues

## Concepts
There exist registers that keep track of program and memory.
Memory size is the same as program size, and has the same dimension.

## Instructions

Red: Increment current register by S, advance V
Yellow: Advance register by S, advance V
Green: Rotate instruction clockwise by 90 degrees, increment register by S, advance V
Cyan: Rotate register clockwise by 90 degrees, increment register by S, advance V
Blue: Check register against S:
    If S > register, rotate instruction counterclockwise by 90 degrees
    If S < register, rotate instruction clockwise by 90 degrees
    If S == register, do nothing
Magenta: Output value at register, advance register by S, advance V
